# Assignment-06
#### Introduction:
For this week's assignment, I focused on tailoring the various webpages of myhealthfinder.gov in accordance with the usability testing, observations, and personas I've created over the last few weeks. While myhealthfinder.gov has enormous potential to be a valuable resource for millions of Americans getting their basic health questions answered at their fingertips, the existing site has a lot of interface issues, especially on the homepage. This prototype, which has newly improved features such as an accessible main menu, a favorite's option for health articles one might like, and a share/print option for vaccines and screenings they still need to complete, allow the user to make the most of the website and truly cater it to their own needs so that the information obtained is valuable to them in the long run. 

#### Tasks: 
1. Fill out the immunization/screening questionnaire and look at your results. Mark whatever immunizations you have completed, and email the ones that you still have to do to yourself.
2. Find information about Nutrition during Pregnancy. Among the many articles, favorite one to have in your archives for later.
3. Without looking over the main menu, find an article related to diet suggestions pertaining to diebetes.

#### Reflection:
While the prototype I used was based off other basic websites in order to make the interface readible and predicatable to the user, there was still a bit of confusion on whether certain things (like the favorite icon) was clickable or not, since it there is nothing besides the icon there with no system feedback to encourage you to click on it. In addition, the favorites folder could be made more clear, since the user was very confused on how the website would save these articles for later if you don't have to register for an account.
