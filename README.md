# Assignment-06
#### Introduction:
For this week's assignment, I focused on tailoring the various webpages of myhealthfinder.gov in accordance with the usability testing, observations, and personas I've created over the last few weeks. While myhealthfinder.gov has enormous potential to be a valuable resource for millions of Americans getting their basic health questions answered at their fingertips, the existing site has a lot of interface issues, especially on the homepage. This prototype, which has newly improved features such as an accessible main menu, a favorite's option for health articles one might like, and a share/print option for vaccines and screenings they still need to complete, allow the user to make the most of the website and truly cater it to their own needs so that the information obtained is valuable to them in the long run. 

#### Tasks: 
1. Fill out the immunization/screening questionnaire and look at your results. Mark whatever immunizations you have completed, and email the ones that you still have to do to yourself.
2. Find information about Nutrition during Pregnancy. Among the many articles, favorite one to have in your archives for later.
3.
